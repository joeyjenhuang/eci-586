## 1. PREPARE

During the final week of each unit, we will complete a "case study" to
illustrate how Learning Analytics methods and techniques can be applied
to address research questions of interest, create useful data products,
and conduct reproducible research.

Each case study is structured around a basic research workflow modeled
after the Data-Intensive Research Workflow fromÂ [Learning Analytics Goes
to School](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134)Â (Krumm et
al., 2018). The primary purpose of these case studies is from *Learning
Analytics Goes to School* (Krumm et al., 2018):

![Figure 2.2 Steps of Data-Intensive Research
Workflow](img/workflow.png){width="70%"}

For Unit 1, we will focus on analysis of open-ended survey items from an
evaluation of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction
(NCDPI) online professional development offered as part of the state's
[Race to the Top](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html)
efforts. For more information about the Race to the Top evaluation work,
visit
[\<https://cerenc.org/rttt-evaluation/\>](https://cerenc.org/rttt-evaluation/){.uri}.\
our focus will be on getting our text "tidy" so we can perform some
basic word counts, look at words that occur at a higher rate in a group
of documents, and examine words that are unique to those document
groups. Specifically, the Unit 1 Walkthrough will cover the following
workflow topics:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, it's critical to understand the
    context and data sources you're working with so you can formulate
    useful and answerable questions. You'll also need to set up a
    "Project" for our Unit 1 walkthrough.
2.  **Wrangle**: Wrangling data entails the work of manipulating,
    cleaning, transforming, and merging data. In section 2 we focus on
    reading, reducing, and tidying our data.
3.  **Explore**: In section 3, we use simple summary statistics, more
    sophisticated approaches like term frequency-inverse document
    frequency (tf-idf), and basic data visualization to explore our data
    and see what insight it provides in response to our question.
4.  **Model** our data until Unit 3 when we learn about topic models, we
    will be developing "data products" next week to
5.  **Communicate** our findings and insights.

### 1a. Review the Literature

Our Unit Case Study is guided by a well-cited publication by

[![](img/mining-lms-data.jpeg){width="40%"}](https://doi.org/10.1177/23328584211024261)

Open)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23328584211024261)

#### Abstract

Earlier studies have suggested that higher education institutions could
harness the predictive power of Learning Management System (LMS) data to
develop reporting tools that identify at-risk students and allow for
more timely pedagogical interventions. This paper confirms and extends
this proposition by providing data from an international research
project investigating **which student online activities accurately
predict academic achievement.** Analysis of LMS tracking data from a
Blackboard Vista-supported course identified 15 variables demonstrating
a significant simple correlation with student final grade... Moreover,
**network analysis of course discussion forums** afforded insight into
the development of the student learning community by identifying
disconnected students, patterns of student-to-student communication, and
instructor positioning within the network. This study affirms that
pedagogically meaningful information can be extracted from LMS-generated
student tracking data, and discusses how these findings are informing
the **development of a dashboardlike reporting tool for educators** that
will extract and visualize real-time data on student engagement and
likelihood of success.

#### Data Sources

Similar to data used in the we'll be using later in case study,
Rosenberg et al. used publicly accessible data from Twitter collected
using the Full-Archive Twitter API and the `rtweet` package in R.
Specifically, the authors accessed tweets and user information from the
hashtag-based \#NGSSchat online community, all tweets that included any
of the following phrases, with "/" indicating an additional phrase
featuring the respective plural form: "ngss", "next generation science
standard/s", "next gen science standard/s".

#### Analysis

Also similar to what we'll demonstrate in Lab 3, the authors determined
Tweet sentiment using the Java version of SentiStrength to assign tweets
to two 5-point scales of sentiment, one for positivity and one for
negativity, because SentiStrength is a validated measure for sentiment
in short informal texts (Thelwall et al., 2011). In addition, they used
this tool because Wang and Fikis (2019) used it to explore the sentiment
of CCSS-related posts. We'll be using the AFINN sentiment lexicon which
also assigns words in a tweet to two 5-point scales, in addition to
exploring some other sentiment lexicons to see if they produce similar
results.

The authors also used the `lme4` package in R to run a mixed effects (or
multi-level) model to determine if sentiment changes over time and
differs between teachers and non-teacher. We won't look at the
relationships between tweet sentiment, time and teachers in these labs,
but we will take a look at the correlation between words within tweets
in TM Learning Lab 2.

**Summary of Key Findings**

1.  Contrasting with sentiment about CSSS, sentiment about the NGSS
    science education reform effort is overwhelmingly positive, with
    approximately 9 positive tweets for every negative tweet.
2.  Teachers were more positive than non-teachers, and sentiment became
    substantially more positive over the ten years of NGSS-related
    posts.
3.  Differences between the context of the tweets were small, but those
    that did not include the \#NGSSchat hashtag became more positive
    over time than those posts that did not include the hashtag.
4.  Individuals posted more tweets during \#NGSSchat chats, the
    sentiment of their posts was more positive, suggesting that while
    the context of individual tweets has a small effect (with posts not
    including the hashtag becoming more positive over time), the effect
    upon individuals of being involved in the \#NGSSchat was positive.

Finally, you can watch Dr. Rosenberg provide a quick 3-minute overview
of this work at
[\<https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x\>](https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x){.uri}

### 1b. Define Questions

One overarching question that Silge and Robinson (2018) identify as a
central question to text mining and natural language processing, and
that we'll explore throughout the text mining labs this year, is the
question:

> How do we to **quantify** what a document or collection of documents
> is about? The questions guiding the Rosenberg et al. study attempt to
> quantify public sentiment around the NGSS and how that sentiment
> changes over time. Specifically, they asked:

1.  What is the public sentiment expressed toward the NGSS?
2.  How does sentiment for teachers differ from non-teachers?
3.  How do tweets posted to \#NGSSchat differ from those without the
    hashtag?
4.  How does participation in \#NGSSchat relate to the public sentiment
    individuals express?
5.  How does public sentiment vary over time?

For our first lab on text mining in STEM education, we'll use approaches
similar to those used by the authors cited above to better understand
public discourse surrounding these standards, particularly as they
relate to STEM education. We will also try to guage public sentiment
around the NGSS, by comparing how much more positive or negative NGSS
tweets are relative to CSSS tweets. Specifically, in the next four
learning lab we'll attempt to answer the following questions:

1.  What are the most frequent words or phrases used in reference to
    tweets about the CCSS and NGSS?
2.  What words and hashtags commonly occur together?
3.  How does sentiment for NGSS compare to sentiment for CCSS?

### 1c. Load Libraries

#### tidyverse ðŸ“¦

![](img/tidyverse.png){width="40%"}

As noted in our Getting Started activity, R uses "packages" and add-ons
that enhance its functionality. One package that we'll be using
extensively is {tidyverse}. The {tidyverse} package is actually a
[collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed
for reading, wrangling, and exploring data and which all share an
underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. This shared
features are sometimes "tidy data principles."

Click the green arrow in the right corner of the "code chunk" that
follows to load the {tidyverse} library as well as the {here} package
introduced in previous labs.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

Again, don't worry if you saw a number of messages: those probably mean
that the tidyverse loaded just fine. Any conflicts you may have seen
mean that functions in these packages you loaded have the same name as
functions in other packages and R will default to function from the last
loaded package unless you specify otherwise.

## 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning,
reshaping, transforming, and merging data (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017).
The importance of data wrangling is difficult to overstate, as it
involves the initial steps of going from raw data to a dataset that can
be explored and modeled (Krumm et al, 2018). In Part 2, we focus on the
the following

a.  **Import Data**. In this section, we introduce the `read_csv()`
    function for working with CSV files revisit some key functions to
    inspecting our data.

b.  **Tidy Data**. We revisit some key {dplyr} functions like `mutate()`
    for creating or changing variables, and introduce the `separate()`
    and `clean_names()` functions for getting our data nice and tidy.

c.  **Join Data**. We conclude our data wrangling by introducing
    j`oin()`Â functions for merging our processed files into a single
    data frame for analysis.

### a. Import Data

Education data are stored in all sorts of different file formats and
structures. In this course, we'll discuss several of these common
formats, how to import your data into R, and how to transform you data
into other data formats such as network objects required for social
network analysis in Unit 3. In this case study, we'll focus on working
with **Comma-separated values (CSV)** files.

Similar to spreadsheet formats Excel and Google Sheets, CSVs allow us to
store rectangular data frames, but in a much simpler plain-text format,
where all the important information in the file is represented by text.
Note that "text" here refers to numbers, letters, and symbols you can
type on your keyboard. In [Tidyverse Skills for Data
Science](Tidyverse%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science), Wright et al.
(2021) note that the advantage of CSVs is that

> ... that there are no workbooks or metadata making it difficult to
> open these files. CSVs are flexible files and are thus the preferred
> storage method for tabular data for many data scientists .

#### Data Source \#1: Log Data

*Log-trace data* is data generated from our interactions with digital
technologies, such as archived data from social media postings. In
education, an increasingly common source of log-trace data is that
generated from interactions with LMS and other digital tools.

The data we will use is a summary type of log-trace data: the number of
minutes students spent on the course. While this data type is fairly
straightforward, there are even more complex sources of log-trace data
out there (e.g., time stamps associated with when students started and
stopped accessing the course). We'll name this data set `time_spent`, to
help us to quickly recollect what function it serves in this analysis.

```{r}
time_spent <- read_csv(here("unit-1", "data", "log-data.csv"))
```

Type `time_spent` into the console (below this window) and then hit
return/enter. You should see a printed summary of this data frame. What
do you notice about this data? What do you wonder? Add a note (or
more---you can type return/enter after a bullet point to add another) on
your noticings and wonderings here:

-   

#### Data Source \#2: Academic Achievement Data

In addition to the `time_spent` data we loaded We'll explain a bit more
about the second data set - on academic achievement data.

Academic achievement data is (obviously) is a very common form of data
in education. In this learning lab, we'll use both the sum of the points
students earned as well as the number of points possible to compute the
percentage of points they earned in the course---a measure comparable
(but likely a little different based on teachers' grading policies) to
their final grade. We'll use this in the second learning lab.

We'll load the data in the same way as earlier:

```{r}
gradebook <- read_csv(here("unit-1", "data", "gradebook-summary.csv"))
```

You may choose to type the name of the gradebook into the console window
and to then (like earlier) type enter/return to view a summary of what
data this name points to.

#### Data Source \#3: Self-Report Survey

The third data source is a self-report survey. This was data collected
before the start of the course. The survey included ten items, each
corresponding to one of three motivation measures: interest, utility
value, and perceived competence. These were chosen for their alignment
with one way to think about students' motivation, to what extent they
expect to do well (corresponding to their perceived competence) and
their value for what they are learning (corresponding to their interest
and utility value). We'll use this in the third learning lab.

We'll read this file, named `survey.csv`, which is---like our other data
files---stored in the `/data` directory.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

In the code below, read the `survey.csv` file. You can use the code
above as a template. Assign the output from the `read_csv()` function to
a new object named `survey`.

```{r}
survey <- read_csv(here("unit-1", "data", "survey.csv"))
```

**Hint**: By asking you to "assign the output from the `read_csv()`
function the name `survey`, consider how in the code chunk above this
"Your Turn" code chunk, we assigned the output from the `read_csv()`
function to the name `gradebook`.

After reading the data, let's continue the practice of looking at our
data. Type `survey` into the console to take a look at the data: Does it
appear to be the correct file? What do the variables seem to be about?
What wrangling steps do we need to take? Taking a quick peak at the data
helps us to begin to formulate answers to these and is an important step
in any data analysis, especially as we *prepare* for what we are going
to do.

Add one or more of the things you notice or wonder about the data here:

-   

#### View Data

Once your data is in R, there are many different ways you can view it.
Give each of the following at try:

```{r}
# enter the name of your data frame and view directly in the console or a code chunk
survey
```

```{r}
# view your data frame transposed so your can see every column and the first few entries
glimpse(survey) 
```

```{r}
# look at just the first six entries
head(survey) 
```

```{r}
# or the last six entries
tail(survey) 
```

```{r}
# view the names of your variables or columns
names(survey) 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# or view in source pane
View(survey)
```

Yes, the "V" is capitalized---very unusual for an R function. Because
this function is a bit atypical in more ways than one, I have two
recommendations concerning its use:

-   Use it strictly in the console. Because it opens a new viewing
    window, including it in an R Markdown script can cause issues when
    "knitting" or rendering an HTML (or PDF) report. Hence I have
    included the `eval = FALSE` argument in the code chunk so it it not
    run when you knit your document.

-   Close the viewer window that opens once you have viewed the data.
    Keeping it open can clutter your work space a bit and can lead to
    confusion about what data frame it was you viewed.

### b. Tidy Data

Intro...

#### Process Log Data

Earlier, we loaded `time_spent`, which contains information on the
number of minutes that students spent on the course, as well as other
variables, particularly `course_id`.

Information about the course subject, semester, and section are stored
in a single variable---`course_id`. This format of data storage is not
ideal, nor is it very "tidy." If we instead give each piece of
information its own column, we'll have more opportunities for later
analysis. We'll use a function called `separate()` to do this.

First, let's practice with a small data set. We'll create it directly in
R; run the code below to do that (and to assign the name `df` to the
dataset).

```{r}
df <- tibble(course_var = c("Fall - Chemistry", 
                            "Fall - Earth Science", 
                            "Spring - Forensic Science",
                            "Spring - Earth Science",
                            "Spring - Biology"))

df
```

Print `df` to the console. You should see a single variable,
`course_info`, with four rows.

In this (very small) data frame, there is information about both the
semester and the course are encoded within the same variable. The
`separate()` function has two primary arguments, one each for:

1.  the variable you want to separate
2.  the names of the new variables to create

Below, see using `course_var` for \#1, and `c("Semester", "Course")` for
\#2, can be used to separate the semester and course data into two
separate variable

```{r}
df %>% 
  separate(course_var, c("semester", "course"))
```

Next, let's try something slightly different. Here, we have a data frame
with a variable that encodes three pieces of information within the same
variable: the year, semester, and subject. There are also a few other
differences.

```{r}
df2 <- tibble(course_variable = c("19-Fall-Algebra I", 
                                  "20-Fall-Algebra II", 
                                  "20-Spring-Algebra I",
                                  "20-Spring-Algebra II",
                                  "21-Fall-Algebra I"))
df2
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Can you separate the variable in the above data frame not into two, but
rather three, new variables? Below is some template code.

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  separate(course_variable,
           c("year", "semester", "subject"))
```

**Hint**: Try to modify the code from above (in which you separated
`course_var` into two variables) based on a) the name of the variable in
`df2` and b) adding the name for the third new variable you wish to
create.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Let's return back to our `time_spent` data frame, now. It is often
helpful to take a look at the data before writing code.

Below, we will load `time_spent` and run the `separate()` function with
the `course_id` variable to split up the subject, semester, and section
so we can use them later on. In other words, whereas above we separated
the variable `course_variable`, in the data set we'll use here, we'll
separate the `course_id` variable.

```{r}
time_spent %>%
  separate(course_id,
           c("subject", "semester", "section"))
```

There is one last key step---one that is likely to be a bit disorienting
at first---that we'll do next. Once we've processed the data how we
would like, we have to assign, or save, the results back to the name for
the data with which we have been working. This is done with the
assignment operator, or the \<- symbol. Copy the code you successfully
ran in the chunk above to follow the assignment operator in the chunk
below. In other words, write the code you wrote above, but assign the
output back to `time_spent`.

```{r}
time_spent <- time_spent %>%
  separate(course_id,
           c("subject", "semester", "section"))
```

We have made a habit of continually looking at our data after running
code to ensure that the step worked as intended. Not in a code chunk,
but rather in the console below, type the name of the data we have been
working with to ensure that the course_id variable has been separated
into three variables that correspond to the subject, semester, and
section.

If those look good, let's proceed to the next step. If something doesn't
look right, consider re-running the code chunks above, perhaps returning
all the way to the first code chunk that you ran (to load the data) to
ensure that the output is as you intended for it to be.

##### Mutating a column to change the time spent variable to represent hours

In the above code, you used separate to create new variables based on an
existing variable. While that function serves a specific problem (when
there are effectively multiple variables combined in one), its use
represents a pattern that is fairly common: you use a function to solve
a problem; figuring out how it works, checking the output, then
assigning the output back to the name of the data frame, after which you
can proceed to the next step.

There are a lot of other functions like separate that help you to solve
specific problems, and we'll introduce many over the two-week institute
- and will point you to resources that describe many more.

There are also functions that can serve as general purpose tools that
can solve many problems; one of the most useful is `` mutate()` ``, a
function to create new variables in a data set. Specifically, we'll use
`mutate()` to create a new variable for the percentage of points each
student earned; keep in mind as you work through these steps how so many
parts of wrangling data involves either changing a variable or creating
a new one. For these purposes, mutate can be very helpful.

Let's begin again with a small data set with two variables, `var_a` and
`var_b`. Run the chunk below.

```{r}
df3 <- tibble(var_a = c(30, 50, 30, 10, 30, 40, 40, 30, 20, 50),
              var_b = c(100, 90, 60, 70, 60, 80, 70, 50, 30, 20))
```

Next, print `df3` to the console. You should see two numeric variables;
imagine they represent points that students earned on a 50-point quiz
and a 100-point test, respectively. There are a lot of things that you
might wish to do with these variables. For instance, you may wish to sum
them together. The code below does this.

```{r}
df3 %>% 
  mutate(points_sum = var_a + var_b)
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

We can combine many `mutate()` functions together. Below, create a new
variable (let's call it `points_proportion`) that represents the
proportion of the total points students could, potentially, earn. To do
this, you can divide `points_sum` by the maximum possible points---150.

```{r}
df3 %>% 
  mutate(points_sum = var_a + var_b) %>% 
  mutate(points_proportion = points_sum / 150)
```

**Hint**: Just like you can use the + symbol to add variables together,
you can use the / symbol to divide a variable by another---or by a
value, like 150!

After adding the above, you should see output that contains four
variables, one each for `var_a` and `var_b`, `points_sum`, which
represents the sum of the points students earned, and
`points_proportion`, which represents the percentage of the total points
students earned.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Let's now process the `time_spent` variable. Specifically, this variable
currently represents the number of *minutes* that students spent on the
course LMS. Below, add to the template of code below to create a new
variable, `time_spent_hours`, that represents the number of *hours* that
students spent on the course LMS.

```{r}
time_spent %>% 
  mutate(time_spent_hours = time_spent / 60)
```

**Hint**: Refer to the code you wrote above, being clear about a) what
the name of the new variable you are creating is and b) how you will
create this variable using division (by the number of minutes in an
hour).

We used the above as a test bed to ensure that our code worked as
intended. Once we are confident that we are creating the variable in the
way we intend to, we can assign the output back to the data frame that
`time_spent` refers to.

```{r}
time_spent <- time_spent %>% 
  mutate(time_spent_hours = time_spent / 60)
```

Good work wrangling this dataset!

#### Process Gradebook Data

Now let's process the gradebook data. In particular, we'll separate the
`course_id` variable in the same way we separated that variable in the
log data, and we'll also calculate a new variable representing the
proportion of points students earned (out of the points possible to
earn).

Let's start with separating the `course_id` variable. Run the code in
the next chunk to do this. If you named the three parts of the course ID
differently than they're named below (and saved the data you processed
to use in this learning lab), be sure that these three variables are
named identically; this is the *key* (pun intended!) to these variables
joining correctly.

```{r}
gradebook <- gradebook %>% 
  separate(course_id,
           c("subject", "semester", "section"))
```

Next, we'll mutate our data set to create a new column, one representing
the proportion of points students earned. Let's consider a data frame
with example data, `df4` .

```{r}
df4 <- tibble(var_a = c(8, 8, 7, 8, 9, 6, 8, 8, 7, 8),
              var_b = 9)
```

*Note*: To create `df4`, for `var_a`, we passed a *vector* that we
created with the function `c()` that contains 10 values. Consider these
to be the number of times that learners participated in an
outside-of-school STEM club. Instead of passing another vector for
`var_b`, we simply used the value 9, which represents the number of
opportunities students had to participate in the outside-of--school STEM
club . In this case, the value 9 is repeated for however many rows there
are in the data frame. Thus, in the context of creating a data frame,
`var_b = 9` is the same as `var_b = c(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9)`.

Since interpreting proportions when the denominator is nine can be
difficult, we may which to create a variable for the proportion.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

After running the chunk above, print `df4` to the console to get a sense
of what the data frame consists of. To create a third variable that
represents the proportion of STEM club activities students participated
in, divide `var_a` by `var_b`.

```{r}
df4 <- df4 %>% 
  mutate(var_a / var_b)
```

What happens if the output is different than you intended? That's no
problem! Re-run the code-chunk *above* (in which we create `df`) to have
a blank slate with which to try again.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Your turn once more. This time, create a new variable---here, let's name
it `proportion_earned`---using the `gradebook` data. This will involve
using the mutate function with the `gradebook` data, creating a new
variable (`proportion_earned`) on the basis of the values of two
existing variables:

-   `total_points_possible`

-   `total_points_earned`

Also, once your code is ready, you'll need to assign the results back to
`gradebook`. This is challenging as you're starting from scratch with
the code. However, good R programmers use other code (that they or
others wrote!) often, so feel free to copy and paste code from other,
similar problems to give yourself a head start.

```{r}
gradebook <- gradebook %>% 
  mutate(proportion_earned = total_points_earned / total_points_possible)
```

Once the above step is complete, take another look at `gradebook` by
printing it to the console or viewing it using a preferred method. There
should now be seven columns, the six originally in the data and a new,
seventh variable you've "mutated."

#### Process Survey Data

Finally, let's process our survey data that we imported earlier . First
though, take a quick look again by typing `survey` into the console or
using a preferred viewing method to take a look at the data.

Does it appear to be the correct file? What do the variables seem to be
about? What wrangling steps do we need to take? Taking a quick peak at
the data helps us to begin to formulate answers to these and is an
important step in any data analysis, especially as we *prepare* for what
we are going to do.

Add one or more of the things you notice or wonder about the data here:

-   

You may have noticed that `student_ID` is not formatted the same as
`student_id` in our other files. This is important because in the next
section when were "join," or merge, our data files, these variables will
need to have identical names.

Fortunately there is a handy function called `clean_names()` in the
{janitor} package for standardizing variable names. Run the following
code

```{r}
survey <- clean_names(survey)
```

Let's take one more look at the data by typing its name into the console
or using a method of your choice to check that the above function
appeared to work; if it did, the names should be lower-case, and any
symbols or spaces should now be replaced by an underscore (`_`).

### c. Joining the data

We're now ready to join! At their core, joins involve operations on two
data frames at the same time. This may seem useful only in certain
cases, but consider the following data analysis tasks:

-   You have collected data from *students* from one of ten classrooms;
    at the same time, you have data on the *teachers* of those ten
    classes (five of which tried out a new curriculum, and five who
    taught a "business-as-usual" curriculum

-   You are studying the posts on *Twitter* and *Pinterest* of one of
    around 100 mathematics teachers

-   After working with a local school district, you collected survey
    responses from 100s of *teachers* who teach in one of approximately
    25 elementary, middle, and high *schools*; you received data from
    the district on the characteristics of the schools, including how
    many students they serve and how many teachers work in them

In each of these cases---and many others like them---your single
analysis involves multiple data files. While in some cases it is
possible to analyze each data set individually, it is often useful (or
necessary, depending upon your goal) to join these sources of data
together. This is especially the case for learning analytics research,
in which researchers and analysts often are interested in understanding
teaching and learning through the lens of multiple data sources,
including digital data, institutional records, and survey data, among
other sources. In all of these cases, knowing how to promptly join
together files---even files with tens of thousands of hundreds of
thousands of rows---can be empowering.

Consider two example data frames. `df5` contains a variable with four
student names, `name` and a variable for the number of STEM-related
classes they have taken, `n_stem_classes`.

`df6` contains a variable with three student names, `name` (like in
`df5`), as well as another, different variable, for students'
self-reported interest in STEM topics, `interest_in_stem`, measured on a
one-seven scale, with seven indicating higher levels of interest.

Run the code below and then type `df5` and `df6` in the console.

```{r}
df5 <- tibble(name = c("Sheila", "Tayla", "Marcus"),
              n_stem_classes = c(4, 5, 6))

df5

df6 <- tibble(name = c("Tayla", "Marcus", "Sheila", "Vin"),
              interest_in_stem = c(4, 7, 6, 6))

df6
```

A key (pun intended) with joins is to consider what variable(s) will
serve as the *key*. This is the variable to join by.

A key must have two characteristics; it is:

-   a character string--- a word (thus, you cannot join on a number
    unless you "coerce" or change it to be a character string, first)

-   present in both of the data frames you are joining.

To join two datasets, it is important that the *key* (or *keys*) on
which you are joining the data is formatted identically. The key
represents an identifier that is present in both of the data sets you
are joining. For instance, you may have data collected from (or created
about) the same students that are from two very different sources, such
as a self-report survey of students and their teacher-assigned grades in
class.

While some of the time it takes some thought to determine what the key
is (or what the keys are---you can join on multiple keys!), in the above
case, there is just one variable that meets both of the above
characteristics.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

In the code below, enter the name of the variable that is the key within
the quotation marks following `by =`. Then run the code chunk and note
the output.

```{r}
full_join(df5, df6, by = "name")
```

What do you notice about the output of the `full_join()`? All
observations are valid; consider how the output is similar to and
different from `df5` and `df6`, particularly in one or more notes
following the bullet point.

-   

`full_join()` is one of a number of joins from which we can choose.
`full_join()` is distinguished from the other joins by how it returns
*all* of the rows in both of the data frames being joined. If a
particular key is present in one of the data frames but not the other,
the values for the variable in the data set for which the key is not
present are simply recorded as missing (like in the above, where there
is no value for the number of STEM classes Vin has taken).

There is one other join on which we'll focus for now. That is
`left_join()`, which differs from `full_join()` in that it returns all
of the rows in the "left" data frame, the data frame named first in the
function, but not all of the rows in the "right" data frame: it retains
only the rows in the "right" data frame, the data frame named second in
the function, that have a matching key. An example is necessary. Before
running the code below, add the same key you added above.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

```{r}
left_join(df5, df6, by = "name")
```

Different from the above, `left_join()` did not return all of the rows
from both data frames, instead returning *all* of the rows in the "left"
data frame (and those in the "right" data frame with a match).

#### Join Gradebook and Log Data

For now, we're going to use a single join function, `full_join()`. In
the code below, join `gradebook` and `time_spent`; type the names of
those two data frames as arguments to the `full_join()` function in a
similar manner as in the `full_join()` code above, and then run this
code chunk. For now, don't specify anything for the `by =` part of the
function.

```{r}
# join together the gradebook and log_wrangled
joined_data <- full_join(gradebook, time_spent)

joined_data
```

You may notice a red message that says
`Joining, by = c("student_id", "Course", "Subject", "Section")`. This is
telling us that these files are being joined on the basis of all four of
these variables matching in both data sets; in other words, for rows to
be joined, they must match identically on all four of these variables.

This is related to not specifying anything for the `by =` part of the
function; by default, `full_join()` (and `left_join()`) will consider
any character strings with identical names that are present in both data
sets to be keys. But, it's generally better practice to specify the
variables on which we are joining.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

In the code below, write your join like above, but add the
`by = c("student_id", "course", "subject", "section")` part to your
code. You may notice the red message you may have noticed does not
appear. This is generally a better practice because you know precisely
on which variables you data sets are joining.

```{r}
# join together the gradebook and time_spent
joined_data <- full_join(gradebook, time_spent, by = c("student_id", "subject", "semester", "section"))

joined_data
```

**Hint:** If you're curious about how to format the use of the `by =`
part of your code, look up above at how you used this argument to the
`full_join()` function.

What do you notice about the result---the data you joined? In
particular, how does it differ from the two data sets from which it was
created? Add one or more notes below.

-   

#### Join Gradebook and Log Data

Now

Join

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# join together the gradebook and log_wrangled
data_to_explore <- full_join(joined_data, survey, by = c("student_id", "subject", "semester", "section"))

data_to_explore
```

```{r}
joined_data <- joined_data %>%
  mutate(student_id = as.character(student_id))
```

```{r}
data_to_explore <- full_join(joined_data, survey, by = c("student_id", "subject", "semester", "section"))

data_to_explore
```

We'll revisit joins in our Unit 2 tutorials, but for a quick overview of
the different join functions with helpful visuals,

## 3. EXPLORE

As highlighted in both
[DSEIUR](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html#doing-analysis-exploring-visualizing-and-modeling-data)
and Learning Analytics Goes to School, calculating summary statistics
and data visualization are a key part of exploratory data analysis. One
goal in this phase is explore questions that drove the original analysis
and develop new questions and hypotheses to test in later stages. Topics
addressed in Part 3 include:

-   **Data Visualization**.

-   **Table Summaries**. We learn about the global regular expression
    parser, orÂ `grep`Â package in R, to search for key words among our
    data set.

### a. Data Visualization

#### Histograms

We're now ready to create a faceted plot. Like in the getting started
task, we'll use the ggplot2 package.

The code below creates a histogram with 30 bins---the default number for
`geom_histogram`. Change the number of bins below and note any
differences in what you interpret about the data.

```{r}
data_to_explore %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_spent_hours)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

What do you think the ideal number of bins is---with what is ideal being
the number of bins that helps you to interpret the overall distribution
of the values for how much time students' spent (*note*: there is no one
right or wrong answer here!)?

-   

We'll next be using the `facet_wrap()` function to create *small
multiples*, or plots that are specific to subsets of your data. These
subsets are identified based on another variable in your dataset. For
example, the code below uses the built-in `mpg` dataset to plot the
relationship between the displacement of a car's engine and its highway
miles per gallon fuel efficiency.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

The code in the next plot creates individual plots for each
class---think compact car or SUV.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

In the code below, create a faceted histogram based on the subject of
the course. To do so, consider both:

-   What code you used to create the histogram of the time students'
    spent on the course

-   How, in the example above, `facet_wrap` refers to the variable in
    that data frame that represents the class of the car---but modifying
    the code to work for your subject variable

You may also wish to change the color; reflect back to the getting
started task for an example of how to do this.

```{r}
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~subject)
```

What do you notice about this figure? And what do you wonder? Add a note
(or a few notes!) below:

-   

#### Scatter Plots

Having prepared both of the data sets we joined together, and worked
hard to join those data sets, we're now ready to use this joined data
set in our exploration of how the time students spent on the course LMS
relate to the number of points they earned throughout the course.

We'll be using the {ggplot2} package again, but, this time, will be
creating a different type of plot.

Run the code below to create a scatter plot of the proportion of points
students earned and the number of hours they spent on the course LMS.

```{r}
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours, y = proportion_earned)) +
  geom_point()
```

What do you notice about this graph? And what do you wonder? How about
the code---what do you notice about it (and what do you wonder)? Add one
or more of what you see as the most important elements.

-   

Using {ggplot2} makes it efficient to iterate through different versions
of similar plots. For instance, we can color the points by a third
variable, such as the reason for which students enrolled in the course,
to begin to explore what was going on for students who spent very little
time on the course:

```{r}
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours, y = proportion_earned, color = enrollment_status)) +
  geom_point()
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

We can also additionally create faceted plots, like the one you created
in the last learning lab. In the code below, facet the plot by
`subject`.

```{r}
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours, y = proportion_earned, color = enrollment_status)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~subject)
```

You may wish to style your plot. A few ways you can do that are as
follows; we'll discuss more throughout the institute. For each of the
following, add them to your plot by adding a plus symbol to the line
prior to the line you are adding. For instance, the following code
styles the x-axis label of a plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours, y = proportion_earned, color = enrollment_status)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Time Spent (Hours)")
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Try adding (and modifying, if you'd like) any of the following to the
faceted plot you created in the code chunk below:

-   `xlab("Time Spent (Hours)")`

-   `ylab("Proportion of Points Earned")`

-   `scale_color_brewer("Enrollment Status", type = "qual", palette = 3)`

-   `ggtitle("How Time Spent on Course LMS is Related to Points Earned in the Course")`

-   `theme(legend.position = "bottom")`

```{r}

```

Once you have settled on a plot you are happy with (for now!), add a
sentence or two interpreting your graph (like you were describing it
within a manuscript):

-   

### **b**. Table Summaries

At this point, we should have quite the comprehensive data set,
including single measures from a) students for the time they spent in
the course LMS and other information about them, such as information on
why they are enrolled in the course, b) their academic achievement

We'll explore our data in two ways---by creating:

1.  Descriptive statistics for key variables in our data
2.  A correlation matrix for key variables that are numbers

We'll take these in turn, considering two different ways to create
correlation tables that may be suited better to particular tasks
depending on one's goals.

#### Skimr Package

![](img/skimr.png){width="25%"}

An efficient package for creating descriptive statistics *when your goal
is to understand your data internally* (rather than to create a table
for an external-to-the-research-team audience, like for a journal
article) is the {skimr} package. A key feature of the {skimr} package is
that it works well with the {tidyverse} packages we are using: it takes
data frames as input, and returns data frames as output, which means we
can manipulate them with {tidyverse} functions like `select()`,
`filter()`, and `arrange()`, for example.

Let's load the {skimr} package:

```{r}
library(skimr)
```

The challenge here is not the complexity of the `skim()` function, per
se, but will be comprehending the terminology. In the code chunk below:

-   Pass to the `skim()` function a single argument (recall from our
    tutorials last week that functions have *names* and *arguments!*)

-   That single *argument* is the data frame (aka in tidyverse parlance,
    a tibble) for which you are aiming to calculate descriptive
    statistics

Run the following code to "skim" our `data_to_explore` tibble:

```{r}
skim(data_to_explore)
```

**Note:** If you are having difficult viewing your data in the code
chunk, try clicking the icon in the output that looks like a spreadsheet
with an arrow on it to expand your output in a separate window.

What do you notice about the output? These observations might pertain to
the format of the output or its values (i.e., what the mean for the
`val` variable is). Note one or two of these noticings or wonderings
below:

-   

As we noted earlier, the {skimr} package works nicely with other
{tidyverse} functions.

**Hint:** For help, also consider running `?skim()` in the console to
view the documentation for the function.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Recall from the Week 3 tutorials and exercises how we how we isolated
data using the `select()` and `filter()` functions. In the code chunk
below, look at descriptives for just `proportion_earned` , `time_spent`
and `gender`, but only for the "OcnA" and "PhysA" subjects.

Can you do this by modifying the code below to do this?

```{r}
data_to_explore %>% 
  select(proportion_earned, time_spent, gender, subject) %>% 
  filter(subject == "OcnA" | subject == "PhysA") %>%
  skim()
```

We noted earlier that this output is best for internal use. This is
because the output is rich, but not well-suited to exporting to a table
that you add, for instance, to a Google Docs or Microsoft Word
manuscript. Of course, these values can be entered manually into a
table, but we'll also discuss ways later on to create tables that are
ready--or nearly-ready--to be added directly to manuscripts.

If you are curious about doing more with {skimr}, check out:
[\<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/skimr.html\>](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/skimr.html){.uri}

## 4. MODEL

As highlighted inÂ [Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html), theÂ **Model**Â step of
the data science process entails "using statistical models, from simple
to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data." The authors
note that while descriptive statistics and data visualization during
theÂ **Explore**Â step can help us to identify patterns and relationships
in our data, statistical models can be used to help us determine if
relationships, patterns and trends are actually meaningful. In part Part
4 we will learn how to:

a.  

### a. Create a Correlation Matrix

As highlighted in @macfadyen2010,

There are two efficient ways to create correlation matrices, one that is
best for internal use, and one that is best for inclusion in a
manuscript.

#### Corrr Package

![](img/corrr.png){width="25%"}

First, the {corrr} package provides a way to create a correlation matrix
in a {tidyverse}-friendly way. Like for the {skimr} package, it can take
as little as a line of code to create a correlation matrix. If not
familiar, a correlation matrix is a table that presents how *all of the
variables* are related to *all of the other variables*.

Run the following code to load the {corrr} package:

```{r}
library(corrr)
```

#### Time Spent and Course Grade

Since the primary purpose of this case study is to investigate whether
time spent in an online course is predictive of student achievement,
let's first take a look and see if there is a simple correlation between
time spent and student achievement.

Run the following code to create a simple correlation matrix using the
`correlate()` function from the {corrr} package:

```{r}
data_to_explore %>% 
  select(proportion_earned, time_spent_hours) %>%
  correlate()
```

For the purpose of printing, and as a quick aside, the {corrr} package
also has a nice `fashion()` function for converting a correlation data
frame into a matrix with the correlations cleanly formatted (leading
zeros removed; spaced for signs) and the diagonal (or any NA) left
blank.

Run the following code to try it out:

```{r}
data_to_explore %>% 
  select(proportion_earned, time_spent_hours, int, val, percomp) %>% 
  correlate() %>% 
  rearrange() %>%
  shave() %>%
  fashion()
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

In the code chunk below, select 3-4 numeric variables in addition to
`time_spent_hours` that you think may be related to student achievement,
i.e. `proportion_earned`, and run a simple correlation.

```{r}

```

**Hint:** One key is to correlate only numeric variables. Note that
while some numeric variables can *technically* be used, it is likely not
sensible to correlate all of the variables; some---for instance, the
`section` variable---are not very sensible to correlate!

What did you find? Were your selected variables related to time spent in
the course? These observations might pertain to the format of the output
or its values (i.e., what the mean for the `val` variable is). Note one
or two of these noticings or wonderings below:

-   

If you are interested in learning more about the {corrr} package, visit:
<https://corrr.tidymodels.org>

#### APA Formatted Tables

As we noted earlier, the {skimr} package works nicely with other
{tidyverse} functions. While {corrr} is a nice package to quickly create
a correlation matrix, you may wish to create one that is ready to be
added directly to a dissertation or journal article. {apaTables} is
great for creating more formal forms of output that can be added
directly to an APA-formatted manuscript; it also has functionality for
regression and other types of model output. It is not as friendly to
{tidyverse} functions; first, we need to select only the variables we
wish to correlate.

Then, we can use that subset of the variables as the argument to
the`apa.cor.table()` function.

Run the following code to create a subset of the larger
`data_to_explore` data frame with the variables you wish to correlate,
then create a correlation table using `apa.cor.table()`.

```{r}
library(apaTables)

data_to_explore_subset <- data_to_explore %>% 
  select(time_spent_hours, proportion_earned, int)

apa.cor.table(data_to_explore_subset)
```

This may look nice, but how to actually add this into a dissertation or
journal article that you might be interested in publishing? Read the
documentation for `apa.cor.table()` by running `?apa.cor.table()` in the
console. Look through the documentation and examples to understand how
to output a file with the formatted correlation table, and then run the
code to do that with your subset of the `data_to_explore` data frame.

```{r}
apa.cor.table(data_to_explore_subset, filename = "cor-table.doc")
```

You should now see a new Word document in your project folder called
`survey-cor-table.doc`. Click on that and you'll be prompted to download
from your browser.

### b. Predict Academic Achievement

For the purpose of this learning lab, let's consider the
`proportion_earned` variable to be our dependent, or the outcome,
variable.

You may be new to linear regression models, or you may have a lot of
experience. In brief, a linear regression model involves estimating the
relationships between one or more *independent variables* with one
dependent variable. Mathematically, it can be written like the
following.

$$
\operatorname{dependentvar} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{independentvar}) + \epsilon
$$

Here, the `dependentvar` is predicted by two *coefficients*, or things
that help to explain the dependent variable. The first coefficient,
$\beta_0$, is the intercept. This coefficient tells us what the
estimated value of the dependent variable is when the independent
variable (`independentvar`) is equal to 0. The other coefficient,
$\beta_1$, or the slope, represents the association of a one-unit change
in the independent variable in the value of the dependent variable.

#### Does Time Spent Predict Grade Earned?

Let's consider a simple concrete example. We'll use the `lm()` function
in R to estimate a linear regression model.

The following code estimates a model in which `proportion_earned`, the
proportion of points students earned, is the dependent variable. It is
predicted by one independent variable, `int`, students' self-reported
interest in science.

```{r}
lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours, 
   data = data_to_explore)
```

Let's take a look at the output.

We can see that the intercept is estimated at 0.53. This tells us that
when students' time spent in the online course is equal to zero, their
predicted proportion of points earned is 0.62---not such a great grade,
but also not surprising! But, for every one-unit, or hour, increase in
time spent in science, their estimate proportion of points earned was
0.0048. So if a student spent, for instance, 40 hours on the course,
their estimated final grade would be .62 + (.0048 \* 40), or around .82,
or 82%. A pretty solid B-!

#### How about interest in science?

We can add additional predictor variables by separating variables with a
plus symbol. Run the following code to add `int`, students'
self-reported interest in science, to our linear model:

```{r}
lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours + int, 
   data = data_to_explore)
```

We can see that the intercept is now estimated at 0.44, which tells us
that when students' time spent and interest are equal to zero, they are
likely fail the course unsurprisingly. Note that that estimate for
interest in science is .046, so for every one-unit increase in `int`, we
should expect an 5 percentage point increase in their grade.

We can save the output of the function to an object---let's say `m1`,
standing for model 1. We can then use the `summary()` function built
into R to view a much more feature-rich summary of the estimated model.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours + int, data = data_to_explore)

summary(m1)
```

There is a lot to unpack in this output, but for now the most important
values to look at are those in the Estimate column, which represent the
intercept and slopes for your linear regression model.

Note that the estimate for `time_spent_hours` is now 0.0042 and
statistically significant. We see that `int`, interest in science, both
of which are statistically significant.

#### Do average students earn an average grade?

Now let's consider the mean values for each of these predictors. Recall
from our tutorials last week the `summarize()` function from the {dplyr}
package used to create summary statistics such as the mean, standard
deviation, or the minimum or maximum of a value. At its core, think of
`summarize()` as a function that returns a single value (whether it's a
mean, median, standard deviation---whichever!) that summarizes a single
column.

Let's use the summarize function to calculate the means for time spent
and interest in science and add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to tell R
that it can ignore missing, or `NA` values, and to calculate the summary
statistic using the non-missing values.

```{r}
data_to_explore %>% 
  summarize(mean_interest = mean(int, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_time = mean(time_spent_hours, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The mean value for interest is quite high. If we multiply the estimate
relationship between interest and proportion of points
earned---0.046---by this, the mean interest across all of the
students---we can determine that students' estimate final grade was
0.046 X 4.3, or **0.197**. For hours spent spent, the average students'
estimate final grade was 0.0042 X 30.48, or **0.128**.

If we add both 0.197 and 0.128 to the intercept, 0.449, that equals
0.774, or about 77%. In other words, a student with average interest in
science who spent an average amount of time in the course earned a
pretty average grade.

Finally, similar to our APA formatted correlation table above, we can
use the {apaTables} package to create a nice regression table that could
be used for later publication:

```{r}
apa.reg.table(m1, filename = "lm-table.doc")
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **â¤µ**

Below, estimate different regression models with at least 2 variables,
save as `m2`, and view a `summary()` of the results:

```{r}
m2 <- lm(proportion_earned ~ int + time_spent_hours + gender + val, data = data_to_explore)

## 5. COMMUNICATE

The final(ish) step in our workflow/process is sharing the results of
analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al.Â (2018) have outline the
following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders
what you have learned through analysis:

1.  **Select**. Communicating what one has learned involves selecting
    among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an
    intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that
    information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form,
    i.e.Â a "data product."

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products,
    research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by
    adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with
    colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate**. Writing a narrative to accompany the data products
    involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related
    research question, describing how best to interpret the data
    product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps
    answer the research question.

For Unit 1 we will keep it simple. In the code chunk below, select a
chart, table or model created above (or create an entirely new one based
a new analysis) that you think an education stakeholder might find
interesting. Beneath the code chunk, write a very brief narrative to
accompany your narrative.
