## READINGS

In addition to watching the Unit 1 intro video, this week you'll be required to read three chapters from [Learning Analytics Goes to School](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134) and find one additional journal article, conference presentation, or scholarly resource to help address our discussion questions for the week. 

### Learning Analytics Goes to School

-   Chapter 1: Introduction 

-   Chapter 2: Data Used in Educational Data-Intensive Research

-   Chapter 4: Legal and Ethical Issues in Using Educational Data

### Self-Selected Resource 

Use the [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine of your choice to locate at least research study,  journal article, conference presentation, or scholarly resource that includes the key words, \"learning analytics\" and addresses a topic of interest to you. Your selection should also address one or more of the discussion topics/questions provided in the forum below. I\'d also encourage you to find less formal resources such as videos or shorter online articles to share with the class and that help us better understand this week\'s topics for discussion. 

## DISCUSSION

In lieu of the peer interaction and discussion of course materials that normally take place "in class", you'll be asked to log in this week and engage with other members of our learning community through this discussion forum. To help guide our discussions, we will collectively address a set of guiding questions provided in each forum. You are also welcome to add your own topics or questions for the class to discuss.

With the exception of the [Selected](https://moodle-courses2122.wolfware.ncsu.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=74662) topic, you are not required to post to every thread or address every question raised in the discussions, particularly if you feel others in the class has thoroughly addressed the topic or questions. Our primary goal for these discussions is to collectively build our understanding of this week's topics through back-and-forth dialogue and avoid a "collective monologue" in which we see 20 variations of effectively the same post.

### Guiding Questions

### Assessment

Grading for this week is fairly lenient, provided that it's clear from your posts that you've done the required readings. Readings and discussion for each unit are worth 6 points and judged based on quantity and quality of your posts.

In term of **quantity** (3 points), you'll be expected to add at least 3 posts in addition to an overview of your the [Selected Resource](https://moodle-courses2122.wolfware.ncsu.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=74662). Your initial post should be shared by Friday to help facilitate discussion.  

In terms of **quality** (3 points), your posts over the next week should provide new or insightful contributions to that question or topic. There is no requisite for the length of each posting, and I strongly recommend taking a look at Table 1 of [Gao\'s productive online discussion model](https://moodle-courses2122.wolfware.ncsu.edu/pluginfile.php/656423/mod_forum/post/161249/Gao%2C%20Wang%2C%20Sun%20-%202009%20-%20A%20new%20model%20of%20productive%20online%20discussion%20and%20its%20implications%20for%20research%20and%20instruction.pdf?time=1629368988570) (also attached below), for ways to contribute to the conversation. 

At minimum, your collective posts should also help us interpret or elaborate on discussion topics, questions, or ideas others have shared by "making connection to the learning materials" and should reference at some point the required video, course text and your self-selected resource.
