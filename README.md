# **ECI 586: An Introduction to Learning Analytics**

## Course Overview

As the use of digital resources continues to expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. In response, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged over the past decade as an interdisciplinary field encompassing Learning (e.g. educational technology, learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. usability, participatory design).

This course will provide students with an overview of the field, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques for working with and exploring data. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared to help educational organizations understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.

**Number of Credits:** 3

**Course Prerequisites/Co-requisites:** This course has no prerequisites.

## **Major Assignments & Assessment**

1.  **Housekeeping (4 pts)**: Students will review the syllabus and "sign" the Online Learner Agreement sent at the beginning of the semester that outlines expectations for participating in an online course. Student will also be required to install necessary software and post a brief introduction of themselves and respond to their peers. 

2.  **Community Engagement (24 pts)**: Week 1 of each unit introduces terminology, core concepts, and applications of an analytical approach through readings, course videos, and discussion. Students will log in throughout week and engage in informal discussion with other members of our learning community. To help guide discussions, students are provided a set of essential questions to address and are also encouraged to explore their own areas of interest. Provided resources are embedded in each discussion topic and are intended to help students address guiding questions and foster a deeper understanding of how Learning Analytics has been applied in educational contexts. Students are asked to use an instructor provided rubric to reflect on and self-assess on their postings both in terms of quality and quantity prior to instructor grading.

3.  **Software Tutorials (24 pts):** In Part 2 of each unit, students gain hands-on experience with text-mining tools and processes using R or SAS. The first week of Part 2 consists of tutorials and resources that will introduce students to reading and wrangling data for analysis, exploring data for interesting patterns or trends, and reporting data in a reproducible way. Full credit will be provided for successful completion of tutorials. 

4.  **Guided Walkthroughs (24 pts)**: In the third week of each unit, students will prepare a brief report or data product on an analysis they conducted using an instructor provided dataset or a data source of your choosing. Product or report will include key finding and insights gained from the analysis. Students are asked to use an instructor provided rubric to reflect on and self-assess on their data product and will be provided exemplar products from prior course offerings.

5.  **Final Project (24 pts)**: In the third week of each unit, students will prepare a brief report or data product on an analysis they conducted using an instructor provided dataset or a data source of your choosing.

**Grading Scale:** The grading scale is based on 100 points:

A+ (97-100), A (94-96), A- (90-93), B+ (87-89), B (84-86), B- (80-83)

C+ (77-79), C (74-76), C- (70-73), D+ (67-69), D (64-66), D- (60-63), F (59 or less)

Full credit is not awarded for late work. Late work accepted but penalized at 15% per week it is late. Assignments submitted by the due date, however, may be revised and resubmitted for a higher grade by the following week. Students experiencing unforeseen circumstances with a resulting excused absence (e.g., family medical emergency) are allowed to make up work without penalty.

**Course Feedback Expectations:** Please contact your instructor via email (shaun.kellogg\@ncsu.edu) with any questions about the course project or other assignments. Your instructor will strive to answer any emails within 24 hours (M-F) and 48 hours on the weekend, and grade submitted assignments within 5-7 days of the due date. In addition, students will be provided ongoing opportunities, and are strongly encouraged, to provide course feedback for to help improve the design of current and future course implementations. 

**Academic Integrity:** Students are bound by the academic integrity policy as stated in the code of student conduct. Therefore, students are required to uphold the university pledge of honor and exercise honesty in completing any assignment.

**COVID -19 Announcement:**

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, public health measures have been implemented across campus.  Students should stay current with these practices and expectations through the [Protect the Pack](https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/) website (<https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/>). The sections below provide expectations and conduct related to COVID-19 issues.

**Health and Participation in Class**  

We are most concerned about your health and the health of your classmates and instructors/TAs. 

-   If you test positive for COVID-19, or are told by a healthcare provider that you are presumed positive for the virus,  please work with your instructor on health accommodations and follow other university guidelines, including self-reporting:  <https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/>. Self-reporting is not only to help provide support to you, but also to assist in contact tracing for containing the spread of the virus. 

-   If you feel unwell, even if you have not been knowingly exposed to COVID-19, please do not come to class. 

-   If you are in quarantine, have been notified that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, or have a personal or family situation related to COVID-19 that prevents you from attending this course in person (or synchronously), please connect with your instructor to discuss the situation and make alternative plans, as necessary. 

-   If you need to make a request for an academic consideration related to COVID-19, such as a discussion about possible options for remote learning, please talk with your advisor for the appropriate process to make a COVID-19 request. 

**Health and Well-Being Resources**

These are difficult times, and academic and personal stress is a natural result. Everyone is encouraged to take care of themselves and their peers.  If you need additional support, there are many resources on campus to help you:

-   Counseling Center (<https://counseling.dasa.ncsu.edu/>) 

-   Health Center (<https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/>) 

-   If the personal behavior of a classmate concerns or worries you, either for the classmate's well-being or yours, we encourage you to report this behavior to the NC State CARES team:  ([go.ncsu.edu/NCSUcares](http://go.ncsu.edu/NCSUcares)).  

-   If you or someone you know are experiencing food, housing or financial insecurity, please see the Pack Essentials Program (<https://dasa.ncsu.edu/pack-essentials/>).

If the delivery mode has a negative impact on your academic performance in this course, the university has provided tools to potentially reduce the impact:
