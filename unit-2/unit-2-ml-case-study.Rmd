## 1. PREPARE

In Unit 2, we pick up where we left off and learn to apply some basic
machine learning techniques to help us understand how a predictive model
might be developed and tested as part of an early warning system to
identify students at risk of failing. Specifically, we will make a very
crude first attempt at developing a testing a logistic regression and a
random forest model that can (we hope!) accurately predict whether a
student is likely to pass or fail and online course. Unlike Unit 1,
where we were interested in identifying factors from data collected
throughout the course that might help explain why students earned the
grade they did, we are instead interested identifying students who may
be at risk before it is too late to intervene.

### 1a. Load Libraries

#### tidymodels 📦

[![](img/tidymodels.svg){width="20%"}](https://www.tidymodels.org)

The [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) package is a "meta-package"
for modeling and statistical analysis that shares the underlying design
philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It includes a core set of
packages that are loaded on startup and contains tools for:

-   data splitting and pre-processing;
-   model selection, tuning, and evaluation;
-   feature selection and variable importance estimation;
-   as well as other functionality.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

In addition to the {tidymodels} package, we'll also be using the
{tidyverse}, and {skimr} packages we learned about in Unit 1. Use the
code chunk below to load these three packages:

```{r}

```

### b. Import & Inspect Data

For this case study, we will again be working again with data from the
online courses introduced in Unit 1. This data is located in the data
folder and named `data-to-explore.csv`. Fortunately, our data has
already been largely wrangled. This will save us quite a bit of time,
which we'll need to help wrap our heads around some supervised machine
learning basics.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

Use the code chunk below to read this data into your R environment and
assign the name `data_to_model`. Note, you may choose to use the {here}
package or you may specify the file path directly:

```{r}
data_to_model <- 
```

As noted in Chapter 14 of Data Science in Education Using R, it's good
practice to inspect your data and make sure it looks the way you expect
it to.

Use the code chunk below to take a look our data, then answer the
questions that follow:

```{r}
glimpse(data_to_model)
```

1.  How many observations and variables are in our dataset?

    -   

2.  Since our goal is develop a model that predicts whether students are
    likely to be at risk of failing, what variable might we use as our
    outcome variable for our model?

    -   

3.  Based on your prior work with this data, and the descriptions of the
    data in [Chapter 7 of
    DSIEUR](before%20it%20is%20too%20late%20to%20intervene.), what are
    some variables collected prior to the course that you think might
    make good predictors of at risk students? Why?

    -   

## 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning,
reshaping, transforming, and merging data (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017).
The importance of data wrangling is difficult to overstate, as it
involves the initial steps of going from raw data to a dataset that can
be explored and modeled (Krumm et al, 2018). In Part 2, we focus on the
the following wrangling processes to:

a.  **Isolate Predictors**. In this section, we will narrow down our
    data set to all potential predictors of interest.

b.  **Preprocess Data**. We create a binary variable outcome we are
    interested in predicting, and remove quite a bit of cruft.

c.  **Split Data**. We split our data into a training and test set that
    will be used to develop a predictive model.

d.  **Create a Recipe**. Finally, we will test our a couple different
    "recipes" for our predictive model and learn how to deal with
    nominal data that we would like to use as predictors.

### a. Isolate Predictors

As you've probably noticed, there is a lot of great information in this
dataset - but we won't need all of it. Estrellado et al. note in DSIEUR
that for statistical reasons and as a good general practice, it's better
to select a few variables you are interested in and go from there:

> At a certain point, adding more variables will *appear* to make your
> analysis more accurate, but will in fact obscure the truth from you.

Unlike Unit 1, we are not interested interested in explaining why
students earned the grade they did after the fact. Instead we are
interested in a more immediate and practical application of modeling,
that is developing a model using machine learning techniques that can
accurately predict whether a student is likely to pass or fail an online
course using information that is available about student before it is
too late to intervene.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

Complete the code chunk below to "select" (hint, hint)
`proportioned_earned` for our outcome variable, as well as any variables
from our `data_to_model` data frame that teachers would have access to
at the start of the course (e.g. survey data, course info, student id
and demographics, etc.). Save as a new data frame named `course_data`
and inspect your data.

```{r}
course_data <- data_to_model %>%
  

```

### **b. Preprocess Data**

Prior to developing a predictive model from our data, we have a little
bit of data processing to do, after which we will divide, or "split,"
our data set into two separate data frames, one for training our
predictive model and one for testing our model to see how well it
performs.

#### Create Outcome Variable

First, however, we need an outcome variable that let's us know if they
have either passed or failed.

Let's combine the hopefully familiar `mutate()` function with the
`if_else()` function also from the {dplyr} package to create a new
variable called `at_risk` which indicates "no" for students whose
`proportioned_earned` is greater than or equal too 66.7% (NC State's
cutoff for a D-) and "yes" if it is not.

```{r}
course_data <- course_data %>% 
  mutate(at_risk = if_else(proportion_earned >= .667, "no", "yes")) 
```

#### Drop Data

As you may have noticed from your inspection of the data earlier, some
students do not have the course grade data at all. Let's use the
`drop_na()` function also from {dplyr} to remove observations with no
grade data and the select function again to remove the
`proportion_earned` variable entirely so we're not tempted to cheat and
use this for what would be a VERY good predictor of being "at risk":

```{r}
course_data <- course_data %>% 
  drop_na(proportion_earned) %>%
  select(-proportion_earned)
```

Let's also use the `na.omit()` function introduced previously to delete
cases listwise (that is, an entire row is deleted if any single value is
missing), since most models does not accept cases with missing data:

```{r}
course_data <- course_data %>%
  na.omit()
```

#### Convert Characters to Factors

While inspecting the data, you may have noticed that many of our
predictors of interest are character variables. For creating models, it
is better to have qualitative variable like `gender` encoded as factors
instead of character strings. Factors store data as categorical
variables, each with its own levels. Because categorical variables are
used in statistical models differently than continuous variables,
storing data as factors ensures that the modeling functions will treat
them correctly.

To do so, we introduce a variation of the `mutate()` function that will
look for any variable that is a character and recode as a factor:

```{r}
course_data <- course_data %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

course_data
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

To reduce all the redundancy caused by demonstrating each step
separately above, complete the following code below by using the pipe
operator to repeat all of these steps starting from isolating predictors
to dropping empty values from `proportion_earned` and removing all
incomplete cases.

```{r}

```

Now inspect your data again and make sure it looks like expected:

```{r}

```

**Hint:** You should see a total of 532 observations and 21 variables
including 1 outcome variable named `at_risk`, 1 student identifier named
`student_id`, and 19 potential predictors.

#### Count proportions

One last step before splitting our data is to take a quick look at the
proportion of students in our final data set that were identified as
at-risk.

To do so, first let's take a count of the number of students labeled
"yes" or "no" of being `at_risk`, and then create a new variable called
proportion that takes the number `n` of each and divides by the total
number:

```{r}
course_data %>%
  count(at_risk) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))
```

As you can see, roughly 17% of students in our data set were identified
as "yes" for being at risk.

### c. Split Data

The authors of Data Science in Education Using R @estrellado2020data
remind us that:

> At its core, machine learning is the process of \"showing\" your
> statistical model only some of the data at once and training the model
> to predict accurately on that training dataset (this is the
> \"learning\" part of machine learning). Then, the model as developed
> on the training data is shown new data - data you had all along, but
> hid from your computer initially - and you see how well the model that
> you developed on the training data performs on this new testing data.
> Eventually, you might use the model on entirely new data.

It is therefore common when beginning a modeling project to [separate
the data set](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/data-splitting.html) into two
partitions:

-   The *training set* is used to estimate, develop, tune, and compare
    models.

-   The *test set* is held in reserve until the end of the project, at
    which point there should only be one or two models under serious
    consideration. It is used as an unbiased source for measuring final
    model performance.

There are different ways to create these partitions of the data and
there is no uniform guideline for determining how much data should be
set aside for testing. The proportion of data can be driven by many
factors, including the size of the original pool of samples and the
total number of predictors. 

After you decide how much to set aside, the most common approach for
actually partitioning your data is to use a random sample. For our
purposes, we'll use random sampling to select 25% for the test set and
use the remainder for the training set, which are the defaults for the
{[rsample](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/)} package.

Additionally, since random sampling uses random numbers, it is important
to set the random number seed. This ensures that the random numbers can
be reproduced at a later time (if needed).

The function `initial_split()` function from the {rsample} package takes
the original data and saves the information on how to make the
partitions.

Run the following code to set the random number seed and make our
initial data split:

```{r}
set.seed(586)

course_split <- initial_split(course_data, 
                              strata = at_risk)
```

Note that we used the `strata =` argument, which conducts a stratified
split. This ensures that, despite the imbalance we noticed in our
`at_risk` variable, our training and test data sets will keep roughly
the same proportions of at-risk students as in the original data. 

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

Type `course_split` into the code chunk below, run, and answer the
question that follows?

```{r}

```

1.  How many observations should we expect to see in our training and
    test sets respectively?

    -   

#### Create a training and test set

The {rsample} package has two aptly named functions for created a
training and testing data set called `training()` and `testing()`
respectively.

Run the following code to split the data into

```{r}
train_data <- training(course_split)

test_data  <- testing(course_split)
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

First take a look at the training and testing sets we just created:

```{r}

```

Next, recycle the code from above to check to see that the proportion of
at-risk students in our training and test data are close to those in our
overall `course_data`:

```{r}

```

Now answer the following questions:

1.  Do the number of observations in each set match your expectations?
    Why?

    -   

2.  Do the proportion of at-risk students in each set match your
    expectations? Why?

    -   

### c. **Create a Recipe**

In this section, we introduce another tidymodels package,
[recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/), which is designed to help
you prepare your data *before* training your model. Recipes are built as
a series of preprocessing steps, such as:

-   converting qualitative predictors to indicator variables (also known
    as dummy variables),

-   transforming data to be on a different scale (e.g., taking the
    logarithm of a variable),

-   transforming whole groups of predictors together,

-   extracting key features from raw variables (e.g., getting the day of
    the week out of a date variable),

and so on. If you are familiar with R's formula interface, a lot of this
might sound familiar and like what a formula already does. Recipes can
be used to do many of the same things, but they have a much wider range
of possibilities.

#### Add a formula

To get started, let's create a recipe for a simple logistic regression
model. Before training the model, we can use a recipe to create a few
new predictors and conduct some preprocessing required by the model.

The [`recipe()` function](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/recipe.html) as
we used it here has two arguments:

-   A **formula**. Any variable on the left-hand side of the tilde (`~`)
    is considered the model outcome (`at_risk` in our case). On the
    right-hand side of the tilde are the predictors. Variables may be
    listed by name, or you can use the dot (`.`) to indicate all other
    variables as predictors.

-   The **data**. A recipe is associated with the data set used to
    create the model. This will typically be the *training* set,
    so `data = train_data` here. Naming a data set doesn't actually
    change the data itself; it is only used to catalog the names of the
    variables and their types, like factors, integers, dates, etc.

Let's create our very first recipe using `at_risk` as our outcome
variable; `int` and `gender` and `enrollment_reason` as predictors; and
`train_data` as our data to train:

```{r}
lr_recipe_1 <- recipe(at_risk ~ int + gender + enrollment_reason,
                      data = train_data)
```

Now let's take a quick peek at our recipe and create a quick summary of
our recipe using the `summary()` function:

```{r}
lr_recipe_1

summary(lr_recipe_1)
```

You can see that our recipe has three predictors and 1 outcome, just as
expected.

#### Create Dummy Variables

Because we'll be using a simple logistic regression model, variables
like `gender` and `enrollment_reason` will need to be coded as [dummy
variables](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/creating-dummy-variables-for-unordered-categories.html).
Dummy coding means transforming a variable with multiple categories into
new variables, where each binary variable indicates the presence and
absence of each category. For example, gender will be recoded to
gender_f, where 1 indicates female and 0 indicates male.

Unlike the standard model formula methods in R, a recipe **does not**
automatically create these dummy variables for you; you'll need to tell
your recipe to add this step. This is for two reasons. First, many
models do not require [numeric
predictors](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/categorical-trees.html), so
dummy variables may not always be preferred. Second, recipes can also be
used for purposes outside of modeling, where non-dummy versions of the
variables may work better. For example, you may want to make a table or
a plot with a variable as a single factor.

For these reasons, you need to explicitly tell recipes to create dummy
variables using `step_dummy()`. Let's add this to our recipe and include
`all_nominal_predictors()` to tell our recipe to change all of our
factor variables to dummy variables:

```{r}
lr_recipe_1 <- 
  recipe(at_risk ~ int + gender + enrollment_reason,
                      data = train_data) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

lr_recipe_1

summary(lr_recipe_1)
```

#### Created a kitchen sink recipe

Before training our model, let's create a second recipe just for
contrast that includes all of our predictors by adding the `.` after the
tilde as noted above.

In addition to our step for creating dummy variables, we'll also have to
indicate that our `student_id` variable is not used for prediction
purposes, but rather as a unique identifier for our students.

To do so, we will have to add
[roles](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/roles.html) to this
recipe using
the [`update_role()` function](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/roles.html)
that lets recipes know that `student_id` is a variable with a custom
role that we called `"ID"` (a role can have any character value).
Whereas our formula includes all variables in the training set other
than `at_risk` as predictors, this tells the recipe to keep these two
variables but not use them as either outcomes or predictors.

Run the following code to add `student_id` as a role to our model:

```{r}
lr_recipe_2 <- 
  recipe(at_risk ~ ., 
         data = train_data) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  update_role(student_id, new_role = "ID") 

lr_recipe_2

summary(lr_recipe_2)
```

## 4. MODEL

### a. Fit a Logistic Regression Model

With tidymodels, we start building a model by specifying the *functional
form* of the model that we want using the [[parsnip]
package](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/). Since our outcome is
binary, the model type we will use is "[logistic
regression](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/logistic_reg.html)".
We can declare this with `logistic_reg()` and assign to an object we
will later use in our workflow:

```{r}
lr_mod <- logistic_reg()
```

That is pretty underwhelming since, on its own, it doesn't really do
much. However, now that the type of model has been specified, a method
for *fitting* or training the model can be stated using the **engine**.

#### Start your engine

The engine value is often a mash-up of different packages that can be
used to fit or train the model as well as the estimation method. For
example, we will use "glm" a generalized linear model for binary
outcomes and default for logistic regression in the {parsnip} package.

Run the following code to finish specifying our model:

```{r}
lr_mod <- 
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm")
```

#### Add to workflow

We will want to use our recipes created earlier across several steps as
we train and test our model. To simplify this process, we can use
a *model workflow*, which pairs a model and recipe together.

This is a straightforward approach because different recipes are often
needed for different models, so when a model and recipe are bundled, it
becomes easier to train and test *workflows*.

We'll use the {[workflows](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/)} package
from tidymodels to bundle our parsnip model (`lr_mod`) with our first
recipe (`lr_recipe_1`).

```{r}
lr_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lr_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(lr_recipe_1)
```

#### Fit model to training set

Now that we have a single workflow that can be used to prepare the
recipe and train the model from the resulting predictors, we can use the
`fit()` function to fit our model to our `train_data`. And again, we set
a random number seed to ensure that if we run this same code again, we
will get the same results in terms of the data partition:

```{r}
set.seed(586)

lr_fit <- 
  lr_workflow %>% 
  fit(data = train_data)
```

This `lr_fit` object has the finalized recipe and fitted model objects
inside. To extract the model fit from the workflow, we will use the
helper functions `extract_fit_parsnip()`. Here we pull the fitted model
object then use the `broom::tidy()` function to get a tidy tibble of
model coefficients:

```{r}
lr_fit %>% 
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>% 
  tidy()
```

Among the predictors included in our model, `int` or interest in subject
area score, seems to be the sole significant predictor of being
identified as at-risk according to our definition. This doesn't bode too
well for our model but let's proceed with testing anyways.

#### Test the model

Now that we've fit our model to our training data, we're FINALLY ready
to test our model on the data we set aside in the beginning. Just to
recap the steps that led to this moment, however, recall that we:

1.  Built the model (`lr_mod`),

2.  Created a preprocessing recipe (`lr_recipe_1`),

3.  Bundled the model and recipe (`lr_workflow`), and

4.  Trained our workflow using a single call to `fit()`.

The next step is to use the trained workflow (`lr_fit`) to predict
outcomes for our unseen test data, which we will do with the
function `predict()`. The `predict()` method applies the recipe to the
new data, then passes them to the fitted model.

```{r}

predict(lr_fit, test_data)
```

Because our outcome variable `at_risk` here is a factor, the output
from `predict()` returns the predicted class: `no` versus `yes`. Not a
super useful output to be honest though.

Fortunately there is an `augment()` function we can use with our
`lr_fir` model and `test_data` to save them together:

Let's use this function, save as `lr_predictions`:

```{r}
lr_predictions <- augment(lr_fit, test_data)
```

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

Take a quick look at `lr_predictions` in the code chunk below and answer
the question that follows?

```{r}

```

Was our model successful at predicting any students who were at-risk?
How do you know?

-   

**Hint:** Scroll to the end of the data frame and take a look at our
original `at_risk` outcome and the `.pred_class` variable which shows
the predicted outcomes.

#### Check model accuracy

As you probably noticed, just looking at the `lr_predictions` object is
not the easiest way to check for model accuracy. Fortunately, the
{[yardstick}](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/) package has an
`accuracy()` function for looking at the overall classification
accuracy, which uses the hard class predictions to measure performance.

Hard class predictions tell us whether our model
predicted `yes` or `no` for each student in the `.pred_class` column, as
well as the estimating a probability. A simple 50% probability cutoff is
used to categorize a student as at risk. For example, student `47448`
had a `.pred_no` probability of 0.8854332 and `.pred_yes` probability of
0.11456677 and so was classified as `no` for not being for `at_risk`.

Run the following code to `select()` these variables followed by the
`accuracy()` function to see how frequently our prediction matched our
observed data:

```{r}
lr_predictions %>%
  select(at_risk, .pred_class) %>%
  accuracy(truth = at_risk, .pred_class)
```

Overall it looks like our model was correct 82% of the time, which we'll
see in a second is not terribly impressive.

Another way to check model accuracy is with the `conf_mat()` function
from {yardstick} for creating a confusion matrix. Recall from our course
text Learning Analytics Goes to School that a confusion matrix is simply
a 2 × 2 table that lists the number of true-negatives, false-negatives,
true-positives, and false-positives.

Run the follow code to create a confusion matrix for our logistic
regression predictions:

```{r}
lr_predictions %>%
conf_mat(at_risk, .pred_class)
```

As you can see our model accurately predicted all students as "no" for
at risk 110 times, but inaccurately predicted 24 students a "no" for at
risk when they were actually "yes" in our `test_data`. Overall our model
was 82% accurate, but it achieved this by simply labeling everyone as
"no" for at risk. And since rough 82% of our students were actually
"no," this is clearly not a great prediction model.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

Recycle our code from above to create a workflow for `lr_recipe_2` and
test our "kitchen sink" model on our test data. **Hint:** You can
accomplish this by simply copying and pasting and changing a single
character from above.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# create workflow


# set seeed


# fit model to workflow


# extract model estimates


# get predictions 


# check overall accuracy 


# create a confusion matrix

```

1.  Does this model perform any better? How do you know?

    -   

### b. Fit a Random Forest Model

[Random forest models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)
are [ensembles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) of
[decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). Each of
those terms is linked because there is a dense amount of information
required to understand what each of those terms really means. For now,
however, them main thing to know is that:

> One of the benefits of a random forest model is that it is very low
> maintenance; it requires very little preprocessing of the data and the
> default parameters tend to give reasonable results.

For that reason, we'll just create a very simple recipe for
our `course_data` data includes all our predictors and singles out our
`student_id` role:

```{r}
rf_recipe <- 
  recipe(at_risk ~ ., 
         data = train_data) %>%
  update_role(student_id, new_role = "ID")

rf_recipe

summary(rf_recipe)
```

To fit a random forest model on the training set, we'll use
the {[parsnip](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/)} package again
along with the
[ranger](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/index.html)
engine. We'll also include the `set_mode()` function to specify our
model as "classification" rather than "regression."

Recall from our Learning Analytics Goes to School that supervised
machined learning, or predictive modeling, involves two broad
approaches: classification and regression. Classification algorithms
model categorical outcomes (e.g., yes or no outcomes like with our at
risk data). Regression algorithms characterize continuous outcomes
(e.g., test scores).

Run the following code to create our random forest model for our
training data:

```{r}
rf_mod <- 
  rand_forest(trees = 1000) %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
```

Now let's combine our model and recipe to create our new random forest
workflow:

```{r}
rf_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_model(rf_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(rf_recipe)
```

And fit our model and recipe to our training data:

```{r}
set.seed(586)

rf_fit <- 
  rf_workflow %>% 
  fit(data = train_data)
```

Gather our random forest predictions:

```{r}

rf_predictions <- augment(rf_fit, test_data)

rf_predictions
```

And check our model's overall accuracy:

```{r}
rf_predictions %>%
  select(at_risk, .pred_class) %>%
  accuracy(truth = at_risk, .pred_class)
```

And create a confusion matrix to see where it did and did not make
accurate predictions:

```{r}
rf_predictions %>%
conf_mat(at_risk, .pred_class)
```

Overall, our random forest model is slightly better at predicting
students who were defined as "at risk", and definitely better at
predicting students who were truly "at risk" according to our
definition.

Unfortunately, if this had been a real-world situation, only 7 of the 24
students would have received additional support. Clearly we'd need to
build a better model. In this case, more data would definitely help, but
it's likely we're missing some important information about students that
might be helpful for including in our model.

#### [**Your Turn**]{style="color: green;"} **⤵**

Try creating your own recipe and a logistic regression or random forest
model and see how it performs against the three that I created.

Use the code chunk below to record your final model:

```{r}

```

Now answer the following questions?

1.  How did you model do compared to others?

    -   

2.  What information might be useful to know about students prior to the
    course start that might be useful for improving our mode?

    -   

## 5. COMMUNICATE

In this case study, we focused applying some basic machine learning
techniques to help us understand how a predictive model used in early
warning systems might actually be developed and tested. Specifically, we
made a very crude first attempt at developing a model using machine
learning techniques that were not terribly great at accurately predict
whether a student is likely to pass or fail and online course.

Below, add a few notes in response to the following prompts:

1.  One thing I took away from this learning lab that I found especially
    useful:

2.  One thing I want to learn more about:
