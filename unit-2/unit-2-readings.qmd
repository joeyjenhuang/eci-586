## OVERVIEW

The primary goal of our Unit 2 readings and discussion is to develop a better understanding of the methods used in data-intensive research, as well as the legal and ethical considerations surrounding these methods and their use of educational data. The required and self-selected readings for this week provide a deep dive to the data-intensive research workflow introduced in the previous unit, legal requirements imposed by federal and state governments, and recommendations for the responsible and ethical use of student data. A secondary goal of our readings and discussion is to help you start generating ideas for your final course project.

## READINGS

In addition to watching the Unit 2 Intro video, this week you'll be required to read two chapters from [Learning Analytics Goes to School](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134) and find one additional journal article, conference presentation, or scholarly resource to help address our discussion questions for the week.

### Learning Analytics Goes to School

-   Chapter 3: Methods Used in Educational Data-Intensive Research
-   Chapter 4: Legal and Ethical Issues in Using Educational Data

### Self-Selected Resource 

Use the [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine of your choice to locate a journal article, presentation, website or other scholarly resource that addresses a topic of interest and includes one or more of the following terms or related terms:

-   learning analytics
-   predictive analytics
-   machine learning
-   algorithmic bias
-   data ethics

Your selection should also address one or more of the discussion topics/questions provided below. In addition, you are welcome to find less formal resources such as videos or shorter online articles to share with the class and that help us better understand this week's topics for discussion.

## DISCUSSION

In lieu of the peer interaction and discussion of course materials that normally take place "in class", you'll be asked to log in this week and engage with other members of our learning community through the course discussion forum. To help guide our discussions, we will collectively address a set of guiding questions provided in each forum. You are also welcome to add your own topics or questions for the class to discuss.

With the exception of the self-selected resource, you are not required to post to every thread or address every question raised in the discussions, particularly if you feel others in the class have thoroughly addressed the topic or questions. Our primary goal for these discussions is to collectively build our understanding of this week's topics through back-and-forth dialogue.

### Guiding Questions

#### Chapter 3: Methods Used in Educational Data-Intensive Research

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

-   What exactly does it mean to **prepare** for collaborative, data-intensive research?
-   What are some common techniques used to **wrangle** data add what do they entail?
-   What exactly is meant by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how why might researchers **explore** data as part of workflow?
-   What are some common approaches used in data-intensive to **model** data and what do they entail?
-   What exactly is involved in the **communicate** step of the data-intensive workflow and what makes a "good" data product used to communicate findings?
-   What are some of the **challenges** of working with big data and data-intensive research in particular?
-   How, and to what extent, might education practitioners **collaborate** on these steps?

#### Chapter 4: Legal and Ethical Issues in Using Educational Data

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

-   What is one **major concern** arising from the proliferation of educational data and what laws or ethical principles have been developed to address it?
-   How might a legal or ethical issue associated with data-intensive research be associated with specific steps of the data-intensive research workflow?
-   What are challenges typically faced with these types of data? What challenges or opportunities do you anticipate for yourself?
-   How might learning analytics be used to better understand a dataset or educational context of personal or professional interest to you?
-   How is the data intensive workflow similar to or different than other data analysis processes you may have come across before?
-   What questions do you still have about data used in data-intensive research like learning analytics?

#### Self-Selected Resource

Provide a brief overview of your self-selected resource that includes the following:

-   APA Citation (note: this can be easily [retrieved via Google Scholar](https://libanswers.ucmerced.edu/faq/95935))
-   What was the **purpose** of your article?
-   What **data source(s),** if any, were analyzed or discussed?
-   What data-intensive research **workflows** steps, if any, were described by your selection?
-   Who were the intended **beneficiaries** of the work and what "change ideas" might the result imply for them?
-   How, if at all, did your resource touch upon the **application(s)** of these methods and phases to "understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?"
-   Did your selection address any **ethical or legal considerations** of LA?

## ASSESSMENT

### Grading

Grading for this week is fairly lenient, provided that it's clear from your posts that you've done the required readings. Readings and discussion for each unit are worth 6 points and judged based on quantity and quality of your posts.

In term of **quantity** (3 points), you'll be expected to add at least 3 posts in addition to an overview of your the Selected Resource. Your initial post should be shared by Friday to help facilitate discussion.

In terms of **quality** (3 points), your posts over the next week should provide new or insightful contributions to the division questions or topics. There is no requisite for the length of each posting, and I strongly recommend taking a look at Table 1 of [Gao's productive online discussion model](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-586/blob/main/unit-1/lit/Gao-productive-discussion.pdf) (summarized below) for ways to contribute to the conversation.

At minimum, your collective posts should also help us interpret or elaborate on discussion topics, questions, or ideas others have shared by "making connection to the learning materials" and should reference at some point the required video, course text and your self-selected resource.

### Productive Online Discussion Model

#### **Disposition 1: Discuss to Comprehend**

Actively engage in such cognitive processes as interpretation, elaboration, **making connections to** prior knowledge.

-   Interpreting or elaborating the ideas by making connection to the **learning materials**
-   Interpreting or elaborating the ideas by making connection to **personal experience**
-   Interpreting or elaborating the ideas by making connection to other **ideas, sources, or references**

#### **Disposition 2: Discuss to Critique**

Carefully **examine other people's views**, and be sensitive and analytical to conflicting views.

-   Building or **adding new insights or ideas** to others' posts
-   **Challenging ideas** in the texts
-   Challenging ideas in others' posts

#### **Disposition 3: Discuss to Construct Knowledge**

Actively **negotiate meanings**, and be ready to reconsider, refine and sometimes revise their thinking.

-   **Comparing views** from the texts or others' posts
-   Facilitating thinking and discussions by **raising questions**
-   Refining and **revising one's own view** based on the texts or others' posts

#### **Disposition 4: Discuss to Share Improved Understanding**

Actively **synthesize knowledge** and explicitly express improved understanding based on a review of previous discussions.

-   **Summarizing personal learning** experiences of online discussions
-   **Synthesizing content** of discussion
-   **Generating new topics** based on a review of previous discussions
